# Work-In-Progress (WIP) Guidelines

## Policy
To ensure flow and reduce context switching, we strictly limit Work-In-Progress.

## Limits
*   **Per Person:** Max 2 active tasks.
*   **Per Team:** Max (Team Size * 1.5) active tasks.

## Exceptions
*   If a task is blocked by an external dependency, it does not count towards the WIP limit *if* it is actively tracked in `BLOCKERS.md`.
*   Urgent hotfixes (P0) can temporarily exceed the limit.
