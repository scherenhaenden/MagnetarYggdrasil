# 🌌 **MagnetarYggdrasil**

### *One project — many universes. A single codebase implemented in every major backend technology.*

---

MagnetarYggdrasil exists to **compare Web APIs across programming languages** — not theoretically, but in reality — by implementing **the same identical application**, same database, same endpoints, same architecture, same test suite, across all ecosystems.

> ⚡ The goal is simple:
> Build *one program* that exists simultaneously in *multiple technology worlds*
> so we can finally see *which ones shine, which ones bleed and why.*

Yggdrasil = the tree that connects worlds.
Magnetar = the densest star in the universe.
**MagnetarYggdrasil = a system that lives in all technological worlds simultaneously.**

---

## 📍 **What this project does**

Every language must implement the same API and use SQLite:

```
Users  → CRUD
Tasks  → CRUD
Health → /health
```

It stores everything in **SQLite**, auto-creates DB on first run, exposes JSON HTTPS endpoints, and includes **100% test coverage** requirements.

# ✨ Purpose of this project

This is **not** tutorial code.
This is research.

We are answering **the real question:**

> What language is truly best for backend systems
> when ALL conditions are equal?

You will feel performance.
You will feel friction.
You will discover what Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft already learned.

And *you will know it for real — because you built all worlds yourself.*
