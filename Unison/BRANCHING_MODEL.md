# Branching Model for Unison

This project follows a simplified GitFlow model.

*   **master:** Production-ready code.
*   **develop:** Integration branch for features.
*   **feature/*:** New features (e.g., `feature/user-api`).
*   **fix/*:** Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/db-connection`).

PRs must pass all tests before merging.
